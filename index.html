    <h1>Hello everyone!! Welcome to the page</h1>
	<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#/media/File:CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg" alt="CSS logo" width="200px"
    <p>Today we are testing my skills as a web developer or <strong>web dev</strong>as young people like to call it. I'm Julien and this is the 3rd day that i'm coding and I'm very exited.<br/>
	I'm really eager to learn more about making websites, creating exiting contents with awesome animation. I feel like a little Kid!!.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How am I doing so far??</h2>

    <p>Well before answering that question we need to put the situation in the context<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>I never ever code before</li>
        <li>My main training was the hospitality management</li>
        <li>I was more focused in the revenue than creating a website</li>
        
        </ul>

		</p>
        
       <p id="white"> So why doing this? Well thanks to the <em>virus</em> the hotel I that worked for laid me off<br/>
        and I realized that it was the wake up that I needed to <em>turn my life around</em><br/>
        I did a bit of soul searching to see what job is needed now and what I can enjoy.<br/><br/>
        
        Web dev was the <strong>obvious</strong> choice. Ok but why??
		</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>lot</strong> of companies are looking for web devs</li>
            <li>the pay is <em>decent</em></li>
            <li>you let your creativity taking over</li>
			<li>i was looking for a new challenge</li>
            
            </ol><br/>
			<p class="words">
            
            In other words you'll be needed :)<br/> <br/>
            To answer to the question earlier : I'm doing ok. I realized that I have<br/>
            a lot to learn and It could be a little bit intense sometime<br/>
