	<p>Today we are testing my skills as a web developer or <strong>web dev</strong> as young people like to call it. I'm Julien and this is the 3rd day that i'm coding and I'm very exited.<br/>
	I'm really eager to learn more about making websites, creating exiting contents with awesome animation. I feel like a little Kid!.
    </p>

    <h2>How am I doing so far??</h2>
<div id="yellow">
	<img id="logo"src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRXW5ldZ89wIqFZDppR3iSoM8suK3d5vyswaw&usqp=CAU" alt="humm intense">
    <p>Well before answering that question we need to put the situation in the context<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>I never ever code before</li>
        <li>My main training was the hospitality management</li>
        <li>I was more focused in the revenue than creating a website</li>
        
        </ul>
				</p>
        
       <p id="white"> So why doing this? Well thanks to the <em>virus</em> the hotel I that worked for laid me off and I realized that it was the wake up that I needed to <em>turn my life around</em><br/>
        I did a bit of soul searching to see what job is needed now and what I can enjoy.<br/><br/>
        <img id="logo"src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT15XZG1vv9zdbOWHlZPAfdEHzhjI0EPZxoeA&usqp=CAU" alt="HTML">
        Web dev was the <strong>obvious</strong> choice. Ok but why??
		</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>lot</strong> of companies are looking for web devs</li>
            <li>the pay is <em>decent</em></li>
            <li>you let your creativity taking over</li>
			<li>i was looking for a new challenge</li>
            
            </ol><br/>
			<p class="words">
            
            In other words you'll be needed :)<br/> <br/>
            To answer to the question earlier : I'm doing ok. I realized that I have a lot to learn and It could be a little bit intense sometime<br/>Anyways, here is journal of what I learn so far.

		<h2>"From Zero to <i>Hero</i>"</h2>
		<div id="red"><p>So here we are digging into the murky world of the Web Development. Fom now on I will try to post everything I learn.<br/>
		I started to download some app into my phone and of course install web editing software (I'm using Notepad ++ now) 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="#first day">First Day!</li></a>
			<li><a href="#13 Feb">13 Feb</li></a>
			<li><a href="#20 Feb">20 Feb</a></li>
			
			</ol>
			
			<p></div>
			<h3 id="first day">First Day</h3>
			<div>
			Well, I began with <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy</a> who taught me the basics of HTML and CSS after a few tries I finaly managed to change text body, add text do some changes
			and everything in between!
			</p></div>
		
		<h3 id="13 Feb">13 Feb</h3>
			<div>
			<p>Well, after some new app "how to learn to code" downloaded I learn how to create a <button>button</button> which is cool.</br>
			But the main event was JavaScript yes, after several days trying to understand what CSS is all about, I've decided to jump into another (yet exiting) coding language. </br>
			JavaScript is not easy but it is logical so I guess you just have to "hang in there"
			</p></div>
			
		<h3 id="20 Feb">20 Feb</h3>
			<div><p>Good news everyone! I've been accept into a WebDev school! 
			The news came out on Monday when I received an email from the WebDev virtual school "Oclock" with a lot of new information.
			If everything is going according to the plan, I'm supposed to begin early 2022. Meanwhile I bought a book "Web Coding & Web Development" of 800 pages
		which will keep me busy until the end of the year ;)</p></div>
